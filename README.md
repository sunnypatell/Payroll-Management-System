To use this payroll management system program in C++, follow these steps:

Download the source code files and place them in a new project directory.

Open the project in a C++ compiler, such as GCC or Microsoft Visual C++.

Build and run the program.

The program will present you with a menu of options:

Addition of New Employee: Allows you to add a new employee to the system. The system will prompt you for the employee's code number, name, address, phone number, joining date (day, month and year), designation, grade, and loan. It will also store information about the employee's basic salary, house allowance, and any other relevant fields.

Modify Employee Record: Allows you to modify an existing employee record. The system will prompt you for the employee's code number, and you can then update any of the employee's information.

Delete Employee Record: Allows you to delete an employee record from the system. The system will prompt you for the employee's code number, and will ask for confirmation before deleting the record.

Print Employee Salary Slip: Allows you to print a salary slip for an employee. The system will prompt you for the employee's code number and the month for which you want to print the salary slip. It will also ask for information about the number of days and overtime hours worked by the employee in the given month. The salary slip will include information about the employee's basic salary, allowances, deductions, and net salary.

Display a Employee Record: Allows you to display the record of a single employee. The system will prompt you for the employee's code number, and will display all of the information about that employee.

Display List of Employees: Allows you to display a list of all employees in the system. The list will include the code number, name, phone number, joining date, designation, grade, and salary of each employee.

Use the menu options to perform various tasks in the payroll management system.

Note that this is just one possible implementation of a payroll management system in C++, and you can modify it to suit your specific needs. You may want to add more fields to the employee struct, or add additional functions to the class to perform additional tasks. You may also want to consider adding error handling and validation to the code, as well as reading and writing the employee records from a file to persist the data across program executions.
